This is a project that a group of 4 people (myself included) took on. It's about programming a game in C# in which you can place bets with in-game money and have to guess
under which hat the ball is. It doesn't work properly, so I don't recommend using this code unless you'd like to correct it, though you are free to use it for your own needs.
